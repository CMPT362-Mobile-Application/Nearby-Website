                        The main goal for Show and Tell 1 was to have an almost completed UI for the Nearby Android App. Currently, the app should allow users to navigate through
                        the UI and will let them interact with some hardcoded data. We have hardcoded map posts on the Map UI so you can currently see what the pin and post will look like conceptually
                        and the comment forum of that pin. Other than the Android app itself, we have also finished the main structure of our project webpage, the UI mockups in Figma, and the MVVM Diagram.

                        The main plan for Show and Tell 2 will be to have the Firebase integration working so we can have our Firebase database setup. This will allow 
                        the user's posts and comments to be stored remotely on a Firebase server that user can then retrieve. We aim to have this work smoothly with our Google Maps
                        display to show the posts of the user's interests.

                        The main goal for Show and Tell 2 was to setup Firebase and have it work with a good majority of our app's planned features. Currently, our app allows users
                        to create posts which are stored remotely in Firebase. These stored posts can then be viewed on the map as actual custom pins we have created which are designated by colour and the activity type. 
                        By clicking on a pin, you can see all of that pin's post details along with an image that is stored on Firebase Storage and you can click the heart to favourite that post to increment their favourite's counter.
                        By clicking the comment button, you can view all the comments on the post and add your own comments or reply to someone else's to get a discussion going.

                    <p>
                        During this time, we have also created our Threads Diagram which we will try to follow closely and have updated the project webpage with up to date content for Show and Tell 2

                        For our final submission, we plan on finishing up our posts filter and our post category feature. In addition, we want to allow our users easy access to posts they've favourited by
                        adding a favourite posts and user made posts page. Finally, we want to do updates to our UI design to make it cleaner and include a custom app icon.
